                critical thinking about presented information, skills needed for the modern society, empathy and complex
                vocational skills.
                Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary
                in their society.
                In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed

                from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be

                through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle
